#Project 0x02 - C Functions and Nested Loops

-mandatory

Nested loops refer to a loop statement within another loop statement, often known as "loop inside loop." This involves incorporating loops within the body of another loopi.

Note: Your header file, named main.h, must include the prototypes of all functions, including the _putchar function. Start by creating the main.h header file. (Refer to the resources provided below for guidance.)

main.h - This crucial header file contains prototypes for all functions used in this project.

0-putchar.c - This program prints the word "_putchar," followed by a new line.

1-alphabet.c - A function that prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line.

2-print_alphabet_x10.c - This function prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each followed by a new line.

3-islower.c - A function to check if a character is lowercase.

4-isalpha.c - A function to check if a character is alphabetic.

5-sign.c - A function to print the sign of a number.

6-abs.c - This function calculates the absolute value of an integer.

7-print_last_digit.c - A function to print the last digit of a number.

8-24_hours.c - A function that prints every minute of the day according to Jack Bauer's schedule, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

10-add.c - A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11-print_to_98.c - This function prints all natural numbers from a given input 'n' up to 98, each followed by a new line.

The file _putchar.c contains the definition of the _putchar() function. This project focuses on C programming concepts, functions, and nested loops. The main.h header file plays a crucial role in organizing and providing access to the function prototypes used across various files.
